Anyway so basically FreeMoneyHub the user who created the notorious hypixel scam website hypixelskyblock.net (Hosted on google LLC ) that we are working hard to try our best to stop. 
We, the people at Skyclient work hard to scams, and this is the biggest scam we found so far. Big credit goes to Angry Pineapple and IlluminatiFish for deobsfucating, nuking and preventing the scam to work as intended.
